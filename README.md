## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Innokentii -- a beginner software engineer with love for experimenting and developing
tools & games! Generally, I am really pationate about making low-requirement things that
can run on as many things as possible.

At the moment I am a 4th year student, working on my thesis.

## As for my engineering pursuits...
